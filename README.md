## Tasks

### Hello World

Go to file `src/main/java/school/mjc/stage0/module1/task1/HelloWorld` and add required code, so that the program prints 
the string "Hello World". Please note that the string is case-sensitive - both words should start with the uppercase letter.

### Printing Everything

Go to file `src/main/java/school/mjc/stage0/module1/task1/PirintingEverything` and finish the code. It should output:
1. String "This is a string"
2. Number 1
3. Number 2
4. Number 3.14
5. Empty line
6. String "This is another string"

And the output should look like that:

    This is a string
    123.14

    This is another string

Hint: you will have to use both `System.out.println` and `System.out.print`.
